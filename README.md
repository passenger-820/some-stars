####  [karinakozarova/Arduino-Dancer](https://github.com/karinakozarova/Arduino-Dancer)
A game for dancing. Can be controlled using a hardware platform or via a keyboard (and for some parts a mouse). For more information, go to the Wiki of this repo.

#### [4TINI/DanceDanceRevolution](https://github.com/4TINI/DanceDanceRevolution)
For the sensors laboratory at Politecnico di Milano we were asked to realize the well known game from the 90s building from scratch the capacitive sensors to realize the platform controller of the game. An Arduino Board was chosen to control all the sensors. A graphical interface was also a request of the assignment. We decided to realize it with Processing a Java based IDE. The two components, ArduinoMicro and graphical computer interface communicate through serial communication.

#### [fluxpat/DinoDance_Game](https://github.com/fluxpat/DinoDance_Game)
This project is a culmination of 2 weeks of learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, and a celebration of the arcade games of the 80s, 90s and early 2000s.

It was an opportunity to practise and implement core concepts whilst learning to code a project from start to finish in a short time frame.

#### [smhuang426/performous](https://github.com/smhuang426/performous)
An open-source karaoke, band and dancing game where one or more players perform a song and the game scores their performances. Supports songs in UltraStar, Frets on Fire and StepMania formats. Microphones and instruments from SingStar, Guitar Hero and Rock Band as well as some dance pads are autodetected.

#### [THUwangcy/Dance](https://github.com/THUwangcy/Dance)

#### [FranklinMao/EE319kGAME](https://github.com/FranklinMao/EE319kGAME)

Handheld Game Competition: Dance-Dance Revolution themed game on ARM Cortex-M TM4C Microcontroller This game includes features of Dance Dance Revolution such as sequences of arrows, edge detection, background music, score tracking, score combos, adjustable speed of music, and realistic graphics. Building this game required knowledge of ADC(analog-digital converter), DAC(digital-analog converter), interrupts, I/O ports, and structs for the arrow mechanics. Materials: -ARM Cortex-M TM4C Microcontroller -ST7735R LCD Display -Potentiometer -ADC -DAC -Switches Video Demo: https://youtu.be/eh6ZrvnCsNA

#### [cwlroda/Dance-Dance-Convolution](https://github.com/cwlroda/Dance-Dance-Convolution)

This project is an interactive gesture recognition game inspired by Just Dance 2019.

*Note: This game was part of a first year college project. Development was centred around an FPGA board (Xilinx PYNQ-Z1) and hence can only be run on one.*

#### [raincrash/DanceDancePose](https://github.com/raincrash/DanceDancePose)

A simple game to learning dancing with pose estimation that you can play on a raspberry pi

#### [A-Tokyo/dance-dance-byte](https://github.com/A-Tokyo/dance-dance-byte)

The game is simple enough. It has n*n squares in big square board, first of all a player should stand in the middle of the dancing board to make the Ultrasonic sensor detect a player and start the game, the squares will start to light up in patterns according to the song. At this time a player should put his/her foot on the square which has a pressure sensor that till the program if it's the right square, according to that the score will calculated, if the player wins a sound will be changed to a winner sound as well as the LEDs will light up the winner pattern otherwise the looser one. The game utilizes Arduino-mega328p.
