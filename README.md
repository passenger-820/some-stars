some stared projects， mostly are not in “your stars”
## dance game
### Arduino-Dancer https://github.com/karinakozarova/Arduino-Dancer
A game for dancing. Can be controlled using a hardware platform or via a keyboard (and for some parts a mouse). For more information, go to the Wiki of this repo.

### DanceDanceRevolution https://github.com/4TINI/DanceDanceRevolution
For the sensors laboratory at Politecnico di Milano we were asked to realize the well known game from the 90s building from scratch the capacitive sensors to realize the platform controller of the game. An Arduino Board was chosen to control all the sensors. A graphical interface was also a request of the assignment. We decided to realize it with Processing a Java based IDE. The two components, ArduinoMicro and graphical computer interface communicate through serial communication.

### Follow-Ma-Lead https://github.com/GuroKung/Follow-Ma-Lead
Follow-Ma-Lead is a realtime multi-player dance game (Unity 2D game)

### DinoDance_Game https://github.com/fluxpat/DinoDance_Game
This project is a culmination of 2 weeks of learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, and a celebration of the arcade games of the 80s, 90s and early 2000s.

It was an opportunity to practise and implement core concepts whilst learning to code a project from start to finish in a short time frame.

### performous https://github.com/smhuang426/performous
